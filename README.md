# Predictive Model Streamlit App

This repository contains both a **predictive model implemented in Python** and an **interactive Streamlit web app** that demonstrates its use.  
Users can explore predictions and insights in real-time using the app, while the Python code includes the full model pipeline, preprocessing, and utilities for training and evaluation.

## ✅ Features
- Interactive Streamlit app to test different scenarios and get predictions
- Full Python code for model training, preprocessing, and utilities
- Visualizations to understand data and model outputs
- Easy-to-run setup with all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## ▶️ How to Use
You can explore the app directly online — **no installation required**!  

👉 **Launch the app here:** https://asa-app.streamlit.app/

The app allows users to test different input scenarios, view predictions, and explore insights generated by the model.
